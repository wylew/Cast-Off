Kaelen: Did anyone else notice that shopkeeper was acting strange?
Mira: Very strange. He kept looking at the door like he was expecting someone.
Theron: Or afraid someone would walk in...
Mira: We should investigate after we rest.

The sea remembers everything. Every ship that sails her, every soul she claims. Show her respect, or she'll show you the depths.

Title: Session 1 Recap - The Port of Saltmere

Our adventure began in the bustling port city of **Saltmere**, where our party first met at the Rusty Anchor tavern. 

### The Party

- **Kaelen** - A mysterious half-elf ranger with a haunted past
- **Mira** - A clever human rogue seeking her fortune
- **Theron** - A stalwart dwarf cleric devoted to the sea goddess

### What Happened

The session kicked off with a mysterious job offer from Captain Rhogar, who needed skilled adventurers for a *delicate* mission involving:

1. Retrieving a stolen artifact
2. Navigating treacherous waters
3. Dealing with rival pirates

The captain mentioned something about "the old lighthouse" and "when the tide is highest" - cryptic words that would prove significant later.

**Highlight of the session**: Mira's incredible deception check to bluff our way past the harbor guards!

DM: As you approach the lighthouse, you see a figure standing at the top.
Kaelen: Can I make out any details?
DM: Roll a perception check.
Kaelen: Natural 20!
DM: The figure turns, and you recognize the symbol on their cloak - it's the mark of the Tide Callers.
Mira: Oh no... not them again.

Sometimes the best plan is the one you make up as you go. Calculated risks, my friends. Calculated risks.

Title: Character Background - Kaelen

Kaelen grew up in the coastal forests north of Saltmere, where the trees meet the sea. Their village was known for training rangers who could navigate both land and water with equal skill.

But one night, everything changed...

> The details of that night are still unclear to Kaelen, but they know it involved mysterious figures, strange magic, and a choice that would haunt them forever.

Now Kaelen wanders the coast, taking odd jobs and searching for answers about what really happened that night - and why they can sometimes hear the ocean calling to them in their dreams.

Theron: We need to talk about what happened back there.
Mira: What's there to talk about? We survived.
Theron: Barely! And only because Kaelen did... whatever that was.
Kaelen: I told you, I don't know what happened. One moment I was drowning, the next...
Mira: The next, the water was obeying you like a trained dog.
Kaelen: It wasn't like that.
Theron: Then what was it like?
Kaelen: It felt like... like coming home.
