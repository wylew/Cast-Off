Title: The Port of Saltmere

Our adventure began in the bustling port city of **Saltmere**, where our party first met at the Rusty Anchor tavern.

## The Party

- **Kaelen** - A mysterious half-elf ranger with a haunted past
- **Mira** - A clever human rogue seeking her fortune  
- **Theron** - A stalwart dwarf cleric devoted to the sea goddess

## What Happened

The session kicked off with a mysterious job offer from Captain Rhogar, who needed skilled adventurers for a delicate mission:

1. Retrieving a stolen artifact from the lighthouse
2. Navigating treacherous waters near the Shattered Isles
3. Dealing with rival pirates who claim the artifact is rightfully theirs

The captain mentioned cryptic words about "when the tide is highest" that would prove significant later.

**Session Highlight**: Mira's incredible deception check (natural 20!) to bluff our way past the harbor guards.

DM: As you approach the lighthouse, you see a figure standing at the top.
Kaelen: Can I make out any details?
DM: Roll a perception check.
Kaelen: Natural 20!
DM: The figure turns, and you recognize the symbol on their cloak - it's the mark of the Tide Callers.
Mira: Oh no... not them again.

The sea remembers everything. Every ship that sails her, every soul she claims. Show her respect, or she'll show you the depths.

Title: The Lighthouse Discovery

When we finally reached the top of the lighthouse, the view was breathtaking. The entire coastline stretched before us, with Saltmere's lights twinkling in the distance.

But we weren't alone.

The Tide Caller agent stood with the artifact in hand—a crystalline orb that pulsed with an eerie blue light. Theron immediately recognized it as a *Sphere of Tides*, an ancient relic that could command the ocean itself.

"You shouldn't have come here," the agent said, their voice carrying an unnatural echo.

And then the fighting began.
