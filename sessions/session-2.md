We discovered the Tide Callers aren't just pirates—they're trying to awaken an ancient sea deity. And Kaelen might be the key to stopping them... or helping them.

Kaelen: Did anyone else notice that shopkeeper was acting strange?
Mira: Very strange. He kept looking at the door like he was expecting someone.

Theron: We need to talk about what happened back there with the water.
Mira: What's there to talk about? We survived.
Theron: Barely! And only because Kaelen did... whatever that was.
Kaelen: I told you, I don't know what happened. One moment I was drowning, the next...
Mira: The next, the water was obeying you like a trained dog.
Kaelen: It wasn't like that.
Theron: Then what was it like?
Kaelen: It felt like... like coming home.
